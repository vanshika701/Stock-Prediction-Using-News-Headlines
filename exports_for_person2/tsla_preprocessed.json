If passed, President Donald Trump is expected to sign the bill into law.That propped up Dow stalwarts such as Goldman Sachs and UnitedHealth Group, with each gaining 3.5%.But the Nasdaq slid again, as some tech-related heavyweights lost ground.

And, you know, the market is really concerned about the level of spending that is going towards AI for each individual company. And for some companies, it makes sense, and for others, it doesn't. And so right now, I think the market is trying to pick the winners and losers thus far as it pertains to AI.\":: AMDAmong Wednesday's winners, AMD rallied 9% after the chip designer unveiled a $100 billion data-center revenue target.:: FileAnd Cisco Systems, up 3% at the close, soared higher in extended trading after the company raised its forecast for full-year profit and revenue, banking on multi-billion-dollar data center expansions.",
